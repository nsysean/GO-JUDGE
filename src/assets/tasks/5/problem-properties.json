Major changes have been made.}\r\n\r\nIn a prison represented by a $N$ by $M$ grid, rows are numbered $1$ to $N$ from top to bottom and columns are numbered $1$ to $M$ from left tor right. ($x, y$) means the cell on the $x$-th row and $y$-th column. \r\n\r\nThere are $2$ prisoners. Prisoner $1$ is located at ($r_1, c_1$). Prisoner $2$ is located at ($r_2, c_2$). A prisoner can only move between two cells if they share a common edge. Prisoner $1$ and $2$ will fight against each other if there is at least one path that goes from ($r_1, c_1$) to ($r_2, c_2$).\r\n\r\nInitially, walls are built directly outside the perimeter of the prison, and all cells inside the prison are pairwise reachable. A prisoner cannot enter a wall.\r\n\r\nYou are allowed to replace some cells with walls. You can only replace a cell with a wall only if there is no prisoner in the cell.\r\n\r\nOutput a set of cells to replace with walls such that the two prisoners will not fight against each other, i.e. there is no path from ($r_1, c_1$) to ($r_2, c_2$). You are allowed to output the same cell more than once, if you wish to. If there is no solution output $-1$.\r\n\r\nSince replacing cells with walls is costly, you want to minimize the number of cells replaced. You may receive a partial score depending on the number of cells replaced.

Note that each cell ($x,y$) must satisfy $1 \\le x \\le N, 1 \\le y \\le M$.
