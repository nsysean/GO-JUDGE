There are $n$ videos in total with indices 1 to $n$ and length $l_1, l_2, l_3 ... l_n$ minutes respectively. Your break is $x$ minutes long and you want to fully use this time (i.e. watch exactly $x$ minutes of video, no more no less). Also, you are too tired to do anything so you just want to choose a video (index $k$, $k\\leq n$) to watch and keep on watching until you finish a video, then you can stop or continue watch video $k+1$ (you can only watch the next video if and only if $k+1\\leq n$). You want to find the number of different ways to watch consecutive video(s) such that you fully spend all of your time. Since you are a big fan of Let's Think Critically, you will never pause a video nor quit watching in the middle of it, meaning that if you watch video $k$, you will watch all $l_k$ minutes. \r\n\r\nIt is also possible that there is no such way to fully spend all $x$ minutes. In this case, output $0$. You are too tired to do math during the break so you want to make a program that helps you answer this question every time you have a break. Time to watch more videos :D.
